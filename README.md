## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following structure:

### Projects

1. Genetic Algorithms: In this Project we learn about genetic algorithms and how we can use them to find results when ordinary search algorithms are not effective. Here given some data points of a polynomial we try to find the best equation to fit them.

2. MDP and Qlearning: In this Project using probabilistic models we find an optimal policy for taking the best action given a discrete environment. Using the MDP models and RL model introduced in the course we solve two famous problems in OpenAI Gym library, Frozen lake and Taxi.

3. Hidden Markon Models: In this Project we learn HMM and how to use it for sound classification using the features that can be extracted from the audio signals. The classification happens based on MFCC features of each audio which can provide fairly good information for this classification task, labeling each audio as one of the blues, metal, hiphop and pop genre.

4. Classification and Regression: In this Project we learn about different machine learning models and how to train them and try to anticipate a target value given the trained model. Here we use different ways to get the target including Linear Regression, KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Ensemble Learning.

5. CNN: In this Projrct we develop an object detection system using computer vision techniques. Here using CNN models we build a model to classify brain tumor based on the MRI picture of the patient brain.

6. News Clustering: In this Project we learn clustring and how to use it label different news provided in the dataset. News clustering is a technique widely used in different search browser.
